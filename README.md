Description: In my software development class, I collaborated with a team of four developers across three time zones to build an inventory management system. We coordinated through scheduled meetings and used Git for version control and seamless code integration. Our system featured a custom RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, supporting full CRUD operations via GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. We integrated a PostgreSQL database and implemented role-based access control to ensure secure data handling. The frontend included a login screen with dynamic session management, allowing us to assign specific privileges to different user roles. To enhance usability, we built an alert system that monitored inventory levels and triggered automated email notifications when stock thresholds were reached — giving users real-time feedback and actionable insights.<br>
