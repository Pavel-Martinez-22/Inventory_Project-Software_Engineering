<p>Project Titel: Inventory Management System Project</p>
<p>
  Description: This project is in collaboration with a team of four developers across three time
  zones to build an inventory management system. We coordinated through scheduled
  meetings and used Git for version control and seamless code integration. Our system
  featured a custom RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, supporting full CRUD
  operations via GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. We integrated a PostgreSQL
  database and implemented role-based access control to ensure secure data handling.
  The frontend included a login screen with dynamic session management, allowing us to
  assign specific privileges to different user roles. To enhance usability, we built
  an alert system that monitored inventory levels and triggered automated email
  notifications when stock thresholds were reached,the system give users real-time
  feedback and actionable insights.
